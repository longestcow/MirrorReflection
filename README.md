# MirrorReflection  
Use space to toggle between mirror and light.  
While in mirror mode, left drag to place walls.  
While in light mode, left drag and release to spawn light ball with the given direction.  
If you just left click without dragging, the light ball will move in a randomly set direction.  
  
This project is pretty much just me trying out LibGDX for the first time.
