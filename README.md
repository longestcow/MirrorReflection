# Mirror Reflection Thing  
Use space to toggle between mirror and light.  
While in mirror mode, left drag to place walls.  
While in light mode, left drag and release to spawn light ball with the given direction.  
If you just left click without dragging, the light ball will move in a randomly set direction.  
  
You can clear the mirrors by pressing c while in mirror mode. This will get rid of all the mirrors excluding the boundary mirrors.  
To get rid of the boundary mirrors, press c when there is no other mirror.  
You can also spawn the boundary mirrors by pressing c when there is 0 mirrors (including boundary mirrors).  
Press c while being in light mode to clear all lights.  

Press e while in mirror mode to remove the most recently added mirror.  
Press e while in light mode to remove the most recently added light.  
  
This project is pretty much just me trying out LibGDX for the first time.
